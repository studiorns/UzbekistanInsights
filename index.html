                    <li><strong>Lack of Direct Flights</strong>: 16% (+2pp) difficult to get there</li>

                    <li><strong>Safety Concerns (21%, -3pp)</strong>: While still the top barrier, the decrease suggests that marketing efforts to address safety perceptions are having a positive impact. Continue to emphasize Abu Dhabi's strong safety record and low crime rates in marketing materials.</li>
                    <li><strong>Perceived Lack of Activities (19%, -5pp)</strong>: The significant decrease indicates that awareness of Abu Dhabi's diverse attractions is improving. Continue to showcase the variety of experiences available, particularly those that align with Uzbekistan travelers' interests in beaches, entertainment, and cultural attractions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Knowledge (18%, -2pp)</strong>: The modest decrease suggests that general awareness campaigns are having some effect, but there is still significant opportunity to educate the market about Abu Dhabi's offerings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Direct Flights (16%, +2pp)</strong>: The increase in this barrier is concerning and represents a practical challenge that marketing alone cannot address. Work with airline partners to explore opportunities for improved connectivity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Expense (12%, +2pp)</strong>: The increase suggests growing price sensitivity in this market. Consider developing value-focused packages and highlighting the range of price points available for accommodations and experiences.</li>

                <p>Based on these barriers, a "Discover Abu Dhabi" campaign highlighting the diversity of activities available (addressing the "Perceived Lack of Activities" and "Lack of Knowledge" barriers) combined with value-focused messaging that emphasizes the range of price points available (addressing the "Expense" barrier) would address three of the five top barriers to visitation from the Uzbekistan market.</p>

                    <li>The growth in "Expense" concerns (+2pp) suggests increasing price sensitivity in the Uzbekistan market, requiring value-focused messaging and package offerings.</li>
                    <li>Despite the overall decrease in "Perceived Lack of Activities" (-5pp), this remains a significant barrier at 19%, indicating continued need for communication about Abu Dhabi's diverse offerings.</li>
                    <li>The slight increase in "Safety Concerns" (+1pp) requires ongoing attention to safety messaging and reassurance in marketing communications.</li>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--primary-light); margin: 20px 0;">

            <ul>
                <li>Broad awareness-building campaigns that introduce Abu Dhabi to the Uzbekistan market</li>
                <li>Addressing safety concerns through messaging that emphasizes Abu Dhabi's strong safety record</li>
                <li>Highlighting the diversity of activities available, particularly beaches, entertainment attractions, and cultural sites</li>
                <li>Developing compact itineraries that maximize the typical 2.9-day stay, focusing on high-impact experiences</li>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--primary-light); margin: 20px 0;">
            
            <p>With these insights and ongoing monitoring of these metrics, DCT - Abu Dhabi can formulate more effective marketing strategies and increase our return on marketing investment in the Uzbekistan market.
